Introduction to practical open source and professional software development

This session will serve as an introduction to open source software, it's practical use and the process of writing it. We will start with concepts and hopefully end up doing some actual coding. This will introduce the tools used for both open and closed software development that students should familiarise themselves with now like version control, trackers, testing and documentation.
